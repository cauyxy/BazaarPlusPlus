BazaarPlusPlus is an open-source project for *The Bazaar*. The in-game BepInEx mod adds a card collection browser, run history, combat replays, tooltip previews, anonymous mode, Chinese terminology, and related quality-of-life features. The desktop installer supports Windows and macOS, while the Decky Loader plugin at the repository root manages installation, updates, repair, and removal on Steam Deck.

Most players should install from [bazaarplusplus.com/download](https://bazaarplusplus.com/download?lang=en); this repository is for developers who want to inspect the implementation, contribute changes, or build locally.

> The bulk of the codebase is led by [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) contributing in collaboration.

## Quick Start

1. Open [bazaarplusplus.com/download](https://bazaarplusplus.com/download?lang=en) and choose the Windows `.exe` or macOS `.dmg`.
2. Close the game before running the installer. For updates, uninstall the old build before installing the new one.
3. Launch *The Bazaar* once after installation so BazaarPlusPlus can finish setup.
4. On the main menu, confirm that the **Card Collection** button appears and the footer version text includes `BPP version`.

Feature guides, hotkeys, and installation details live at [bazaarplusplus.com/tutorial](https://bazaarplusplus.com/tutorial?lang=en).

### Steam Deck (Decky Loader)

1. Install the Steam version of *The Bazaar* (App ID `1617400`), launch it once, and exit it completely.
2. Install [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) and enable ZIP plugin installation in its developer settings.
3. Run `pnpm install && pnpm run bundle` from this repository and copy `out/BazaarPlusPlus-*.zip` to the Deck.
4. Install that ZIP through Decky, open BazaarPlusPlus in the Quick Access Menu, and select **Install BazaarPlusPlus**.

The plugin finds Steam libraries on internal storage and SD cards, downloads the latest Windows installer from the official BazaarPlusPlus R2 release source, verifies the download origin, limits download and extraction sizes, validates the installer structure and payload version, and configures Proton's required `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b"` launch option. The first install downloads about 70 MB. Exit the game before installing, repairing, resetting, or uninstalling.

To remove it, use **Uninstall mod** in the BazaarPlusPlus panel first so the plugin can also restore Steam's launch options. Removing the Decky plugin itself does not remove files already installed in the game directory.

## Feature Overview

### In-Game Mod

- **Card Collection**: Browse items and skills in-game, with filters for hero, tier, size, merchant, and current run day.
- **BazaarDB Auto Upload**: Community-data contribution that uploads end-of-run screenshots and board data in the background. Disabled by default; opt-in only.
- **Run History and Combat Replay**: Press `F8` to browse past runs and key fights, and watch replays and ghost battles.
- **Combat Status Bar**: Shows combat time and pause state, with speed controls — handy for review, recording, and streaming.
- **Anonymous Mode**: Hide the local player name in screenshots, recordings, and streams.
- **Legendary Rank Display**: Hide your rank, show an exaggerated power value, or display rank and rating together.
- **Enchant and Upgrade Previews**: Preview post-enchant or post-upgrade item values directly in tooltips.
- **Chinese Terminology Modes**: Simplified Chinese plus Taiwan and Hong Kong Traditional terminology styles.

### Desktop Installer

- **Cross-platform install**: Windows and macOS, with automatic Steam game-directory detection.
- **Repair / uninstall / reset local data**: Recover from broken installs, replay-data issues, or local-state corruption.
- **Run history management**: View, locate, and clean up locally saved run records and replay videos.
- **Stream Mode**: Start a localhost browser-source service for OBS and similar tools.
- **Auto-update**: Uses Tauri Updater to check for new releases and prompt when available.

## Building From Source

### Prerequisites

- **Mod**: .NET SDK 8+ and a local Steam install of *The Bazaar* so game assemblies can be resolved.
- **Installer**: Node.js 20+, the Rust toolchain, and the system dependencies listed in the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/).
- **Steam Deck plugin**: Node.js 16.14+ and pnpm 9+.
- **Windows**: PowerShell 7.6.0 or newer for the build scripts and development flow.

### Build the Steam Deck plugin

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run check
pnpm run test
pnpm run bundle
```

The installable artifact is written to `out/BazaarPlusPlus-<version>.zip`. The plugin does not bundle the third-party install payload; it downloads and verifies the latest release from the official R2 source on the Deck, so the first install requires an internet connection.

### Build the Mod

```bash
cd bazaarplusplus-mod

# Development build: resolves the local game directory and copies the Debug DLL into BepInEx/plugins
./run.sh build

# Build Debug + Release in one pass
./run.sh all

# Override the game assembly directory explicitly
dotnet build src/BazaarPlusPlus/BazaarPlusPlus.csproj \
  -c Debug \
  -p:ManagedPath="<Steam>/steamapps/common/The Bazaar/.../Managed"
```

### Build the Installer

```bash
cd bazaarplusplus-installer

npm install
npm run dev        # Vite frontend dev server
npm run tauri dev  # full Tauri desktop app

npm run check
npm run test
npm run format

./build.sh --prod  # production package for the host platform
```

Release signing, notarization, and R2 upload flows depend on local environment variables and `signing-secrets/`, which are intentionally not committed. A full release build also requires a local game install, signing material, and the platform dependencies — the public source tree alone is not enough.
